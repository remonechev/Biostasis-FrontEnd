## Navigators:

The navigation logic for the application.

1. **AuthStack**: Pre-authentication stack where the user gets onboard before they log in to their account or create a new account.

2. **SignUpStack**: This stack gets executed while the user signs up and starts creating their account.

3. **MainStack**: This stack gets executed after the user creates their account or when they are already logged in to their account.

4. **Index**: Contains the whole logic and structure for the navigator.

5. **LostConnection**: The component located in the helper directory will get executed if the user loses an internet connection while using the application.
